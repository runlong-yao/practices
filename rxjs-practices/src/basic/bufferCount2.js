bufferCount also takes second argument, when to start the next buffer
for instance, if we have a bufferCount of 3 but second argument (startBufferEvery) of 1:
1st interval value:
buffer 1: [0]
2nd interval value:
buffer 1: [0,1]
buffer 2: [1]
3rd interval value:
buffer 1: [0,1,2] Buffer of 3, emit buffer
buffer 2: [1,2]
buffer 3: [2]
4th interval value:
buffer 2: [1,2,3] Buffer of 3, emit buffer
buffer 3: [2, 3]
buffer 4: [3]
